# so_long - Escape the Dungeon!
In the project so_long, I had the opportunity to create a basic 2D game using 42's custom graphical library called MiniLibX. 

The gameplay involves collecting all the collectibles on the map and then heading to the exit to win. The map is rendered at launch, by reading a .ber file defined by the user. 
The completion of the so_long project gave me an insight to the more technical side of graphics rendering as well as concepts such as hooks and events.
